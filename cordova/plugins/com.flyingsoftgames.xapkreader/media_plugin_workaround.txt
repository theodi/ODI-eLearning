APK expansions cannot unzip/use Cordova Media plugin files, because the Cordova Media and File plugins don't
understand the "content://" URI scheme. (see https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-media/pull/27).
 
If you are using Cordova Crosswalk, there isn't much of a reason to use it anyway, as you can just add
"xwalk --disable-gesture-requirement-for-media-playback" into your "platforms/android/assets/xwalk-command-line" file
to enable media playback without gestures (e.g.: touch events).
